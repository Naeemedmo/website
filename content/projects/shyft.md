Hydrology is the study of water on and beneath the earth's surface, and is of
paramount importance in Norwegian hydropower production.

Statkraft needed help to operationalize a prototype for distributed
hydrological forecasting, and hired one of our consultants to
help. We ended up reimplementing the whole system, using modern
templated C++, and equipping it with a Python interface. The new
system, called Shyft, runs several hundred times faster than the old
prototype, and is currently used both operationally at Statkraft and
as a research tool by hydrologists in academia.  Shyft is open
source, and more information can be found here:
