![Scheduling](/img/schedule.jpg)
A customer wanted to optimise their allocation of manpower relative to demand.
We have developed and implemented a full system that:

 * Forecasts customer behaviour based on historical data, Facebook Prophet and basic statistics.
 * Optimises work schedules based on Google optimization tools.
 * Pushes the resulting schedules into their time-management system.
