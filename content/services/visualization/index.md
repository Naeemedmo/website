A concise and informative visualisation is the key for comprehension and communication of data and analysis 
results.
Especially these days where the amount of `data` is often huge and traditional visualisation forms may not be suitable.
Then, special treatments like data reduction, aggregation are needed to visualise the `data` efficiently.

Visualisation of data plays an important role in data science, machine learning and analysis platforms.
Raw data needs to be inspected, results of computational simulations and algorithm needs to verified, and the end-users
need insight in the data too.
Usually large amount of data available these days makes an efficient visualisation to an no-trivial task.

Our consultants have expertise in standard and advanced data visualisation techniques.
This includes the pre-treatment as reduction, aggregation and contextualising of data.
And advanced methods as combining different visualisation techniques for higher understanding of data.
