Regular expressions are essentially a tiny, highly specialized
programming language. It is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful
information out of unstructured sources. A regular expression is
mainly used in pattern matching with strings, or string matching,
i.e. "find and replace"-like operations. Using this little language,
you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to
match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses,
or TeX commands, or anything you like.

## Course Content

In this course the formal language of regular expression will be
introduced. Afterwards we will show how the language can be applied to
various test cases. We will also discuss the various regular
expression dialects and how to implement regular expressions in a
programming language like Python.

## Prerequisite

This course aims at the introduction to regular expression without any
prior knowledge about the language.

Some experience with [Python](https://www.python.org) can be an advantage.

## Duration: 2-6 hours

## Tools Introduced

Python Regular Expression
: The [Python regular expression
  module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto) is
  an implementation of regular expression made available from inside
  of Python. The expression used here are the the Perl dialect, one of
  the most popular dialects of regular expression.
