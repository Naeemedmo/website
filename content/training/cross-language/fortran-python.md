Fortran is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is
especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It
was once the dominating programming language in numerical intensive
fields, such as physics, mechanics, chemistry and high-performance
computing. To make use of the code developed in Fortran, it is prudent
to integrate the code into other languages. One integration approach
is to us f2py to integrate it into Python.

## Course Content

In this course we will give an introduction to f2py in Python. We will
go through how header files in Fortran can be used create a connection
to create modules in Python. The course will also show how to
integrate other languages as well.

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the Python programming
language, introduced [here](/training/python/introduction/).

## Duration: 1 hours

## Tools Introduced

F2Py
: [f2py](http://www.f2py.com/) is an interface generator that provides
  a connection between Python and Fortran. It is a Python extension
  tool for creating Python C/API modules from signature files.
