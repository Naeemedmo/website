Python, with its many advantages, is still by most standards
considered a slow language. Any operation that is computationally
intensive requires the program to be as fast as possible to keep the
computational time to a minimum. To this extent, one can use a wrapper
between Python and C/C++: The computational bottlenecks can be
addressed in C/C++, while everything else can be done in Python.

## Course Content

In this course we will give an introduction to Swig in Python. We will
go through how header files in C++ can be used to create a connection
to create modules in Python. The course will also show how to
integrate other languages as well.

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the C++ programming
language, introduced [here](/training/cpp/introduction/).

## Duration: 1 hours

## Tools Introduced

Swig
: [Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
  (SWIG)](http://www.swig.org) is an open-source software tool used to
  connect computer programs or libraries written in C or C++ with
  scripting languages such as Python. SWIG will compile an interface
  file and generate code in regular C/C++ and the target programming
  language through shared libraries.
