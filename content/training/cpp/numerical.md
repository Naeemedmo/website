If a program is performing any form of numerical operations, it is
likely that it will become the program bottleneck. To minimize the
impact of the bottleneck, care must be taken to ensure that the code
being executed is as optimized as possible.

## Course Content
In this course we will introduce the numerical library Armadillo. We
sill give an overview of the syntax, and how to employ the language to
solve large scale numerical problems.

## Prerequisite
This course requires some familiarity with the C++ programming
language, introduced here.

## Duration: 2 hours

## Tools Introduced

Armadillo
: Armadillo is a linear algebra software library for the C++
  programming language. It aims to provide efficient and streamlined
  base calculations, while at the same time having a straightforward
  and easy-to-use interface. Its intended target users are scientists
  and engineers.
