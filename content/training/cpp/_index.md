C++ is a general-purpose programminglanguage that combines high-level
features like object-orientation with low-level memory
manipulation. Its low-level features make it a good choice for system
software and other performance-critical or resource-constrained
systems, while its high-level facilities give it great flexibility for
use in application software.
