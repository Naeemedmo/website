worked with C++.

## Course Content
The course will cover the following topics:

- C++ specific syntax
- Data types and typecasting
- Overloading of functions and operators
- I/O in C++
- Pointers
- Commonly used standard library classes

## Prerequisite

Some experience with other programming languages.

## Duration: 2-6 hours

## Tools Introduced
C++
: C++ is a widely used general-purpose, strongly typed, compiled
  programming language. C++ encompasses high-level features, such as
  objects and templates, as well as facilities for low-level memory
  manipulation. Due to its low-level features, C++ offers excellent
  performance, and is often used in performance-critical applications,
  such as drivers and embedded firmware. The high-level features of
  the language also makes it highly flexible, and its many uses
  include system software, client-server applications, and application
  software, such as video games.
