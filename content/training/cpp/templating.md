Templates are a powerful tool in C++ that allows you to write
generalized functions and classes, enabling them to depend on free
parameters that are set whenever they are used. This is commonly used
to create functions that can take arguments of any type as input.

With the C++11 standard, variadic templates were introduced. Variadic
templates not only allows you to make typesafe variadic functions, but
also enables templates to be used for metaprogramming: writing code
that writes code.

## Course Content

In this course, we will give an introduction to programming with C++
templates and variadic functions. Topics include:

- Using templates to create type-independent functions and classes
- Creating variadic tempate functions - functions that take an
  arbitrary number of arguments, while being typesafe
- Metaprogramming with templates: make the compiler write some of your
  code

## Prerequisite

This course requires familiarity with the C++ programming language.

## Duration: 2-4 hours
