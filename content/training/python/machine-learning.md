Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is the study
and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make
predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from
example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions,
rather than following strictly static program instructions. The term
"machine learning" is an umbrella term and can be used to describe one
of the following topics:

- **Classification:** Identifying categories an object belongs to.
- **Regression:** Predict values associated with objects.
- **Clustering:** Automatically group similar objects into sets.
- **Dimension reduction:** Make large-scale problems more manageable.
- **Model selection:** Find and calibrate the best models.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalizing of raw data preparing it for learning
  algorithms.

## Course Content

In this course we will focus on the application of tools to perform
various aspects of machine learning, using the
[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) toolkit. We will touch base
on how the various algorithms work.

## Prerequisite

The course requires familiarity with the
[Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) and
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries, introduced
[here](/training/python/numerical/).

## Duration: 4-6 hours

## Tools Introduced

Scikit-Learn
: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is an open source machine
  learning library for the Python programming language. It features
  various classification, regression and clustering algorithms,
  including support vector machines, random forests, gradient
  boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with
  the Python numerical and scientific libraries Numpy and Scipy.
