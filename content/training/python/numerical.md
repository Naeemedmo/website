The large majority of mathematical modeling requires proper numerical
software. We at Expert Analytics believe that the corner stone for the
vast majority of such problems should be solved using Python. (Though
in many cases it should be combined with programs written in C++, as
addressed [here](/training/cross-language/c-python/))

## Course Content

In this course we will give an introduction to numerical Python. We
will focus on computational speed and illustrate how to process large
data structures using Python's minimal formulation. The course will
also introduce some of the most popular numerical processing tools and
visualize the results.

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the Python programming
language, introduced here.

## Duration: 2-4 hours

## Tools introduced

Numpy
: Numpy is the most popular tool for performing numerical operations
  in Python. The library consist of functions written in C, but with a
  Python explicit frontend. This gives Numpy computation speed
  comparable to buffered C, but the convenience of coding in
  Python. The Numpy syntax should be familiar to those experienced
  with Matlab.
  
Scipy
: Scipy is a toolbox built on to Numpy and provide a vast collection
  of numerical optimization and processing tools. The toolbox contains
  modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration,
  interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing,
  ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

Matplotlib
: Matplotlib is the Scipy recommended library for plotting and
  visualization when using Numpy and Scipy. The library allows for
  easy production of publication quality figures in a variety of
  hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
