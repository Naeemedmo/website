Datasets are in many applications getting so large and complex that
traditional data processing applications are becoming
inadequate. Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation,
search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, querying and
information privacy to mention some aspects of the problem.

## Course Content

In this course we will give an introduction to data frames; containers
for large datasets. It give an overview of how to import and
manipulate datasets, and perform various statistical estimations, with
focus on how to interpret the datasets properly.

## Prerequisite

The course requires familiarity with the
[Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) and
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries, introduced
[here](/training/python/numerical/).

## Duration: 2-6 hours

## Tools Introduced

Pandas
: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a software library written
  for the Python for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it
  offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical
  tables and time series.

Statsmodels
: [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) is a
  Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate
  statistical models, and perform statistical tests. An extensive list
  of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions,
  and result statistics are available for different types of data and
  each estimator.
