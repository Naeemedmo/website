Python is an excellent platform for creating web applications. One of
the more popular tools for this task, that also embraces the
expressiveness of Python, is the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
framework.

## Course Content

Here you will learn how to get a basic website up and running using
the Flask framework. We will also show how the application easily can
be extended from the large collection of extensions, and how to
maintain such an application. Some time will also be allotted to
introducing [Nginx](https://nginx.org/).

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the Python programming
language, introduced [here](/training/python/introduction/).

Experience with HTML/JS/CSS is recommended, but not required.

## Duration: 2-8 hours
