## Tools introduced

Python
: Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
  dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
  readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts
  in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as
  C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable
  clear programs on both a small and large scale.
