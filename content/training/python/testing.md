A development platform is only as good as the testing environment. As
any project grows, a proper framework for implementing tests can
provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the
business to appreciate and understand the risks of software
implementation.

## Course Content

In this course, we will give an introduction to testing in Python. We
will show how simple functionality can be integrated into the
documentation through doctest, and how to scale the functionality.

## Prerequisite

This course requires some familiarity with the Python programming
language, introduced [here](/training/python/introduction/).

## Duration: 1 Hour

## Tools Introduced

Pytest
: [Pytest](https://www.pytest.org/) is a testing framework aimed at
  making a minimal formulation, but yet scales well into complex
  functional testing for applications and libraries. It integrates
  well with most other testing frameworks available in Python, like
  [Doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html),
  [Nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io) and
  [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
