Python is versatile general purpose scripting language with a wide
range of applications. It focuses on readability, and is an excellent
platform for development in the open-source world as well as in the
enterprise. It is highly cross-platform compatible and allows for
building powerful applications from a minimal amount of code.

Python exists currently in both version 2 and 3. We at Expert
analytics teach both, but recommend version 3, if legacy doesn't
require the use of version 2.
