Alexander submitted his master's thesis in Computational Physics at
the University of Oslo in 2018. The subject of his thesis was Monte
Carlo simulations of quantum dots constrained to different potential
wells. For his thesis he developed software in C++ and Python, but he
has experience with C and Java as well. His education has given him
experience in solving complex physical and mathematical problems using
various numerical methods and libraries. This has made him an
experienced programmer and he is good at adapting to new systems as
well as learning new programming languages.

In addition to his physics background he is finishing a bachelor's
degree in Applied Mathematics with Informatics at the University of
Oslo. During his thesis he worked part-time with IT support at the
Physics Department at the University of Oslo and taught science to
children at the Forskerfabrikken summer school.
