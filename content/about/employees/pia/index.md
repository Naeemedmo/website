Her analytical mindset and strong background in physics provide her with a
solid foundation for finding solutions to complex problems. She is interested
in new challenges, with the goal of applying sophisticated physics and math concepts
to develop real world solutions for big data.

Since 2018, she has been working as senior data scientist in the renewable energy sector
in Norway. In this position, she is responsible for the development and implementation of
scalable machine learning solutions for predictive maintenance and production optimization
of hydropower plants and wind parks.
