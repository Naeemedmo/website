Christian holds a PhD in fluid mechanics from the University of Oslo, 
where he also worked as postdoctoral researcher. His expertise includes 
mathematical modeling, numerical methods and programming. 

<!--more-->

During his PhD studies he was involved in several research projects collaborating
with multiple international research institutes. His main responsibility was assessmemnt
of experimental data, development of theoretical models, and the
implementation of numerical solvers. In his time in academia he worked 
on problems related to elastohydrodynamics, lubrication, multiphase flow, 
charging of supercapacitors, and biomechanics.
In addition, he has also worked with reinforcement learning for flow optimization
in tubular networks.

Besides research, Christian is also an exerienced lecturer and he has taught several 
courses in fluid mechanics at the university of Oslo as well as supervising students, 
both at the master and PhD level.
